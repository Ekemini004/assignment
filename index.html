        <li><a href="#Attributes">Attributes</a></li>
      </p>

    <h2 id="Basic structure">Basic Structure</h2>
    <p>An HTML document consists of a series of elements, each enclosed in opening and closing tags. These tags indicate how content should be displayed on a web page.</p>

    <h2 id="elements">Elements and Attributes</h2>
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, and images. Each element can have attributes that provide additional information or modify its behavior.</p>

    <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
    <p>Semantic HTML elements convey meaning to both the browser and the developer, making the structure of a web page more understandable. Examples include <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and more.</p>

    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    <p>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, introducing new elements and features to improve the functionality and accessibility of web pages.</p> 
    
    <h2 id="attributes">HTML Attributes</h2>
<p>HTML attributes provide additional information about elements and modify their behavior. They can be applied to both unpaired (empty) tags, such as <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, and paired tags, such as <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>For unpaired tags, attributes typically define characteristics like the source of an image (<code>src</code>) or alternative text for accessibility (<code>alt</code>).</p>

<p>Paired tags, on the other hand, often use attributes to specify attributes like the destination of a hyperlink (<code>href</code>), or to assign classes and ids for styling and JavaScript manipulation.</p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>HTML is essential for creating content on the web. Understanding its basic structure, elements, and attributes is fundamental for any web developer.</p>
